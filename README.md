# Tech-OS
This small os is great for testing projects however it is still in beta stages and doesn't  work as well as i want it to but i am trying to fix it now so it will be working properly soon.
Make sure you have python installed on your computer also make sure to have git bash installed too.
In the tutorial section i will have videos linked on how to install python and git bash.
